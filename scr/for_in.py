# this for loop is similar to the for each loop in Java

cars = ["bmw", "Audi", "Mercedes", "Lamborghini"]
for c in cars:
    print(c)

    # you can also combine the for loop with other instructions:

    # the len() function returns the number of items in an object
    # if it's a String like here it returns the numbers of
    # characters in the String
    print(len(c))
